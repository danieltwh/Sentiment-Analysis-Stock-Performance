Let's take a closer look at these three stocks.... 1.
Autodesk... Engineers and architects use Autodesk's flagship products to design buildings and other manufacturable goods. Revit, a building information modeling (BIM) program, allows architects to visualize their designs and showcase them to customers.
These creations can be transformed into a virtual reality setting with plugins like Autodesk Rendering. It doesn't take much imagination to understand how these products could be utilized in the metaverse.... A few years ago, Autodesk switched to a subscription pricing model. Since then, revenue has gone straight up.
Instead, Autodesk requires an annual license, creating a recurring revenue stream.... This business model has delivered strong results. During Q3, which ended Oct. 31, Autodesk's revenue rose 18% to $1.12 billion, with subscription revenue making up 95% of the total. Margins were also strong, with operating margins of 17% (GAAP) and 32% (non-GAAP).
Autodesk also gives investors international exposure.... Region Share of Revenue United States 34% Other Americas 7% Europe, Middle East, and Africa 38.5% Asia-Pacific 20.5%... The stock price took a dive after reporting earnings, cratering 15%.
The sell-off can be attributed more to what analysts expected than to management guidance, even though Autodesk still projected 15% growth. After the sell-off, Autodesk trades at a 47 price-to-earnings ratio. While it has recovered from its lows, Autodesk is still a strong buy with more growth on the horizon.
Fortunately, companies like Unity Software and Autodesk are designing the building blocks needed to enable businesses like Match Group to build their metaverse vision. Even if the metaverse flops, each company will still have a thriving business underneath. Growth investors should consider each stock moving into 2022 and beyond.",0.637143,26.550688

Both Nvidia and Amazon use artificial intelligence in a wide range of ways. However, they also both have tons of other business lines. C3.AI, on the other hand, operates exclusively in AI. This makes it one of the top AI companies to invest in when it comes to a pure-play AI stock.
If you’re not familiar, C3.AI essentially offers AI-as-a-service. It helps the most complex organizations in the world operate more efficiently. This means streamlining supply chains, improving employee safety, and optimizing business practices. It currently has 4.8 million AI models in use by other companies.
In this sense, C3.AI helps executives make more informed decisions.... C3.AI has been losing money since going public in late 2019. In 2021, its net losses have been widening every single quarter. This is most likely why its stock is down over 70% so far in 2021.
Land And Expand... Notably, C3.AI now works with 104 customers. This represents a 64% year-over-year increase. C3.AI isn’t working with Mom-and-Pop shops either. Its clients include Sunoco, Raytheon, and the U.S. Department of Defense. These are Big Fish that have even bigger budgets.
Right now, C3.AI needs to keep getting its foot in the door at major organizations. Once a contract is signed, there is plenty of opportunity to provide a valuable service. If the value is there, it’s likely that these businesses will have no problem signing larger contracts later on. This strategy is sometimes called “Land and Expand.”
C3.AI has already done this successfully. In Q2 FY2022, C3.AI expanded its contract with Baker Hughes in terms of both length and size. This was the second time restructuring the contract. Each restructuring means more guaranteed future revenue for C3.AI.
If it can do this successfully, C3.AI will continue to be one of the top AI companies to invest in.... C3.AI just recently went public in late 2020. Since then, this AI stock is down over 70%....

Though the continued lower interest rate environment is likely to strain the companies’ net investment income, the well-performing equity market is expected to lead to increased alternative investment returns. Also, securing additional capital will be cheaper.
Stock Performance... In terms of price performance, American International is a clear winner. American International has gained 52.5% over the past year, outperforming the broader industry’s 5.6% growth. In comparison, MetLife has gained 36.1% over the same period. The S&P 500 Index has rallied 29.1% in the same time frame.
In comparison, American International beat earnings estimates thrice and missed once, with the average surprise being 8.5%. Here, MetLife has an edge over American International.... Return on Equity... Return on equity is a significant profitability measure, which accounts for profits generated on shareholders’ equity.
American International didn’t perform too badly either, generating a free cash flow of $4,570 million during the same time period. Although it is taking strategic initiatives to boost cash flow generating abilities from operations, AIG might take some time to reach MET’s level.
Yet, MetLife’s debt to capitalization of 17.6% is well below the industry average of 28.1%, with American International at a higher level of 32.5%.... Valuation... The price-to-earnings value is one of the most important multiples used for valuing multiline insurers.
MetLife has a better reading than American International.... Final Words... Our comparative analysis shows that MetLife holds an edge over American International in terms of valuation, balance sheet strength, free cash flow generation (partly due to its larger size), ROE and earnings surprise history.
